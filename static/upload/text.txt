Dear Professor Shibuya,

Haven't contact you for a long time. Hope everything is ok at your side!

In accordance with the guidance from IST, I was supposed to send an email to you around the middle of September. In breif, there are mainly about two things.

1. Departure date, air ticket and the details

I have already booked my air ticket. And the flight number is CA6683. I fly out of Qingdao on the 28th September. It will take me about 3 hours to arrive in Narita international airport, Tokyo.

2. Tutor student system

Is there a tutor student for me? I was informed that I should contact you to ask who is my tutor student and to get his/her e-mail address before coming Japan. Please send me the information if a student was assigned to tutor me. Thanks a lot for you.

If there are still some vague and indefinite expressions above, please contact me again.

Thanks for your time, and I am looking forward to hearing from you.

Yours Sincerely,
Li Da
